Hi, Internet. The handles you will usually find me under are *Captain Nooblan* or *null-cipher* or some variation of those.

I work as an Operations Analyst at a cloud services provider in the Waikato region of New Zealand. You can find out more about my work at [vGRID.nz][vgrid-nz].

My interests naturally reside around computers, technology and programming. My work is concerned with networking and virtualisation but I also have side interests in DevOps practices and security.

Pragmatism is an important tenant of anything that I do, so I tend to steer away from web development and the whole mire of flash-in-the-pan technologies that are endemic of that community.
If I invest time learning about a technology, language, framework or practices I try to focus on those that are likely to stand the test of time and remain relevant in the future. If you follow along with me, you won't get left behind!

It is my intention to use this blog to act as a journal of all of the bits and pieces that I work with so that I can come back to old projects and remember exactly how I got here. It may or may not be useful to people out there on the internet, but I am hoping that it will add more value than just regurgitating hard-to-find StackOverflow posts.
